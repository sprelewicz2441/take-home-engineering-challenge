# Take Home Engineering Challenge


## Guidelines

-   This is meant to be an assignment that you spend approximately three hours of dedicated, focused work. We are not looking for overengineered code, but rather progress and practices.

-   Create a repo on Github, use git for source control, and use README.md to document what you built and what your thought process was.

-   Our team builds, alongside our customers and partners, systems engineered to run in production. Given this, please organize, design, and document your solution as if you were going to put into production. We completely understand this might mean you can't do as much in the time budget. Be biased for production-ready over features.

-   Think out loud in your submission's documentation. Document tradeoffs, the rationale behind your technical choices, or things you would do or do differently if you were able to spend more time on the project or do it again.

## The Problem

Your assignment is to make it possible for us to find a food truck given the dataset below of food trucks in San Francisco, and an inputted location.

This is a freeform assignment. You can write a web API that returns a set of food trucks (our team is fluent in JSON). You can write a web frontend that visualizes the nearby food trucks. And don't be constrained by these ideas if you have a better one!

The only requirement for the assignment is that it give us at least 5 food trucks to choose from a particular latitude and longitude.

Feel free to tackle this problem in a way that demonstrates your expertise of an area -- or takes you out of your comfort zone.

San Francisco's food truck open dataset is [located here](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data) and there is an endpoint with a [CSV dump of the latest data here](https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/rqzj-sfat/rows.csv). We've included a [copy of this data](./Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit.csv) in this repo as well.

Good luck! Please send a link to your solution on Github back to us.
